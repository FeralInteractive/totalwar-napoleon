# Example Mod

Welcome to the example mod, this mod will:

1. Unlock all the factions so they can be played by a human.
2. It will not make any other additions so many of the minor factions will have small rosters and not be survivable without using cheats.

To install the mod you should place all three files inside the `FeralEmpireMods` on your phone making sure you own the expansion. You can download the example mod here: [emergent_factions_mod.zip](emergent_factions_mod.zip)

**IMPORTANT** The modding folder inside Napoleon is called EmpireMods. However it is a different location to the one used for Empire.

Your FeralEmpireMods folder should look like this:

Once installed you can launch the game, if you have followed the instructions correctly you will be greeted with a warning that you are running a mod so any issues are not supported by Feral (you should contact the person making the mod).

When you start a new campaign and go to the campaign screens you'll see the additional factions on the map.

A few important notes for making your own mod you can notice from this mod.

1. It's usually better to pack your entire mod into a single pack file to make it easier to install.
2. Mods only need to contain the files you have modified or added. The example mod is under 1 Megabyte in size. Make sure when extracting data from base game packs you only repack the files you've edited. Users will thank you by keeping your mod size down!
3. Like with data packs you only need to add strings you'd modified in your strings file as your file adds/overrides to the default one it doesn't replace it.
4. You can unpack the mod pack file using the unpack command and review all the files inside to see how the mod was made.
